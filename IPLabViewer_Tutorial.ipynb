The result is the possibility to add *User Define Widgets*. These serve the purpose of applying a specific operation or transformation to your images, a transformation that might depend one one or more parameters. **IPLabViewer** allows you to create a function in a Jupyter cell and apply it simultaneously to all images within your **IPLabViewer** object with the help of a set of sliders.

Without advanced knowledge of matplotlib, you would have to manually run the same process several times, and visualize the results each time.
