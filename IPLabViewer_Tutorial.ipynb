      " |  IPLabViewer(image_list, **kwargs)\n",
      " |  \n",
      " |  The ImageViewer class allows you to quickly interact with an image and visualize its properties. You can easily change the brightness and contrast of your image, display a histogram , plot the image with different ranges and in different colormaps, perform operations on your image and access the statistics of it image (or a region of it). Plotted on top of the histogram, you will have a line that demonstrates the minimum and maximum values that are being used with respect to the original (the histogram will always show the original). The parameters and widgets are described below.\n",
      " |  \n",
      " |  For its construction, you should call:\n",
      " |  \n",
      " |  IPLabViewer([image1, image2, ...], **kwargs)\n",
      " |  \n",
      " |  Where the images are numpy arrays.\n",
      " |  \n",
      " |  The extra arguments are:\n",
      " |  - axis (boolean): Display the axis (units in pixels) of the image. Default is False,\n",
      " |  - callbacks (list of functions): The callback for your activation button when you want to include extra widgets (see new_widgets) to perform an operation/transformation on your image. This callback should have as only parameter an img (numpy array), and inside it, get the parameters of your transformation from other widgets, and then call your actual transformation. It should return an image (the result of the transformation),\n",
      " |  - clip_range (list or tuple of int): Indicates the min and max values that will be enforced on all images. Images with values outside this range will be clipped to these values.\n",
      " |  - cmap (string): A string with the colormap desired for the images (currently accepted are 'gray', 'viridis', 'inferno', 'ocean', 'nipy_spectral', 'copper', 'spring' and 'magma'). If you request a different one, the viewer will use the default value, 'gray'.\n",
      " |  - colorbar (boolean): Decides whether to set or not the colorbar from the beginning. The colorbar can later be set through the buttons. Default is False\n",
      " |  - hist (boolean): Display the histogram from the beginning (also displays widgets, has priority over 'widgets'). Default is False. Note that if you include an RGB/RGBA image in your image_list, a histogram will NOT appear for this image. If your image_list consists of only RGB/RGBA images, the whole functionality will be disabled.\n",
      " |  - new_widgets (list of ipywidgets): List of user-defined widgets. This functionality is meant to be used when the user wants to define an operation/transformation on the image, and see the results in real time withour the need to call the viewer again. The first widgets in the list should define the parameters of the operation (sliders, dropdown menus, text, etc.) and the last widget in the list is a button the activates a callback (see callbacks).\n",
      " |  - normalize (boolean): Scale the values of the image to the range [0, 1]. Default is False\n",
      " |  - pixel_grid (boolean): Plot a grid over each pixel. You should only use this function for very small images,\n",
      " |  - scale_range (list or tuple of int): Indicates the min and max values to which all images will be scaled. Not to be confused with clip_range. \n",
      " |  - subplots (list or tuple of int): If given, the Axes in the Figures (both for images and histograms) will have the given shape. If missing, the default behaviour will be set (one single image at a time)\n",
      " |  - title (list of strings): Titles of each of the images. The titles should be given in the same order as the images. If missing, the title will  be set to the stringified variable name of the image, \n",
      " |  - widgets (boolean): Display the widget menu.\n",
      " |  - joint_zoom (boolean) : Enables joint zooming. Default is False.\n",
      " |  \n",
      " |  If you don't set the parameters 'widgets' or 'hist' to True, then only the image with a button 'Show Widgets' and matplotlib's toolbar will be displayed. In the toolbar you will have three buttons:\n",
      " |  \n",
      " |  - Zoom button (square): Click on it and then select a region in your image to zoom to that region. \n",
      " |  - Pan button (cross with arrows): Click on it, then click, hold and drag on an image to pan the image.\n",
      " |  - Save button (disk): Take screenshow of figure and save in png format.\n",
      " |  \n",
      " |  Clicking the button 'Show Widgets' (equivalent to setting 'widgets = True' during construction) will take you to the widgets menu. In here, you will have the following widgets:\n",
      " |  - Brightness & Contrast slider: you can use this slider to adjust the brightness and contrast of grayscale images. When you move it, you will see the black line plotted on top of the histogram automatically update, to show you in which region of the histogram are you,\n",
      " |  - Show or hide histogram button,\n",
      " |  - Options button: It will take you to  the options menu, where you will be able to change the colormap, to show or hide the axis of your image, and to show a colorbar \n",
      " |  - Reset button: Reset all the parameters to the default (brightness and contrast, colormap, zoom)\n",
      " |  - Prev & Next buttons (only if there is more than one image if the parameter subplots was not given): Browse through images\n",
      " |  - Statistics text area: in here you will see the mean, standard deviation, range of values and size of your image. If there are 2 or more images being displayed at the same time, you will get the statistics in a list, where each index is the statistic of the corresponding image. The statistics will update automatically when you do any change to your image.\n",

The result is the possibility to add *User Define Widgets*. These serve the purpose of applying a specific operation or transformation to your images, a transformation that might depend one one or more parameters. **IPLabViewer** allows you to create a function in a Jupyter cell and apply it simultaneously to all images within your **IPLabViewer** object with the help of a set of sliders. The function or transformation will take as parameters:\n",

Without advanced knowledge of matplotlib, you would have to manually run the same process several times, and visualize the results each time. With **IPLabViewer**, you can simply declare the widgets(s) that choose the parameters and an activation function as parameters to the viewer, and it will call your function and update the images for you. \n",
