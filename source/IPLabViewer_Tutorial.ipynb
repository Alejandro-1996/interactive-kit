    "One of the goals of **IPLabViewer** was for it to be as intuitive and simple as possible, but at the same time to offer as much functionality as possible to an interested user. The result is the possibility to add *User Define Widgets*. These serve the purpose of applying a specific operation or transformation to your images, a transformation that might depend one one or more parameters. **IPLabViewer** allows you to create a function in a Jupyter cell and apply it simultaneously to all images within your **IPLabViewer** object with the help of a set of sliders. The function or transformation will take as parameters:\n",
    "\n",
    "* an image (`NumPy array`), and \n",
    "* one or more numerical values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your function will then  apply an operation on the image that depends on the parameters. Without advanced knowledge of matplotlib, you would have to manually run the same process several times, and visualize the results each time. With **IPLabViewer**, you can simply declare your slider(s) and an activation function as parameters to the viewer, and it will call your function and update the images for you. \n",
    "\n",
    "Additional to the core function that actually performs the operation, you need to declare an activation function that will take as input **only an image**, and will get the necessary parameters from the sliders. This activation function will subsequently call your transformation\n",
    "\n",
    "In the next cells, you will see a very basic example. We will apply a pixelwise operation on the image `car`: All the pixels with a value below a treshold (given in $\\%$) will be set to the *maximum* value. We will guide you through all the process.\n",
